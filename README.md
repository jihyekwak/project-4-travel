# About The Project  
Built a web application using Django, Python, PostgreSQL, Heroku Deployment. 

Heroku Deployment : https://travellovers.herokuapp.com/  
(Because Heroku deployment doesn't offer image cloud, the demo site doens't store the uploaded images. Still uploading image is possible and can show the images as long as the site window opens.)
